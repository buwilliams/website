title: What it takes to get a great job
description: Sharing my process for getting that dream job

The first thing that I need to address is mindset. I wrote a couple of related articles ([Learning Chess](/life/learning_chess) and [Wake-up to your dreams](/life/wake_up_to_your_dreams)) that covers the mindset but it's worth writing about here as well. You need 3 things to be successful with nearly anything:

1. Good approach.
2. Intentional practice.
3. Time.

## Approach

1. Process
    - Collect a list of websites to find job opportunies. There are many. Search for the ones that have the kind of jobs which you'd enjoy.
    - Apply with relevent experience, skills, or aptitude.
    - Work hard at interviews: (a) do background research (b) create a company profile (c) think throughoutly about their mission statement and values (d) give best effort with an programming questions or assignments

2. My filtering questions
    - Does the mission inspire me?
    - Do they have funding and a viable sells funnel?
    - Would I enjoy the work?
    - Would I have autonomy?
    - What I enjoy the people?
    - Could I do good daily?
    - What is the compensation package?
    - Do they respect and value me?

3. Defining what I want
    - Work with good people
    - Solve challenging problems
    - While doing meaningful work

4. About me
    - Founder and Entrepreneur
    - Experienced
    - Innovative
    - Life-long learner
    - Self-motivated and driven

5. My hobbies
    - Chess, cooking, hiking, lifting weights, acroyoga, business analysis, innovation, and sustainability.

6. My sells apporach
    - Team player. I respect, honor, and encourage the people around me.
    - Talented (showcase [portfolio](/projects))
    - Be AUTHENTIC. This is the most important in my opinion. Don't sell a version of yourself which does not exist. People pleasing and being considerate are not the same thing. People pleasing is all about saying and doing what you think people want from you. This is a trap! Being considerate is about being authentic AND caring about others. The easiest way to achieve this is to set your mind to genuinely appreciate others.

## Practice (and hard work)

I built several open-source projects. I called my friends to share my job search ideas and process to ask for feedback. It took a lot of practicing and refining to find my groove and even then it was only best effort not best.

Over two months, I had 18 seperate interviews with 5 companies culminating in an exhausting 13 hour all day programming project to receive an offer worth taking. That's not to mention all the companies that did not make it through my filtering questions. And that's all while working a full time job which I couldn't slack on. On nights and weekends, I build several projects some of them were programming related and others were deep business analysis. To put it mildly, it was exhausting.

## Time

This is the hard part. (talk about rejection and getting back up)
