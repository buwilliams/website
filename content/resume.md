## Current Experience (2015-Present)

**Interviewing, Present**

- I'm currently seeking a new role.

**Technical Lead, Workstorm, Mar 2018 - Mar 2021**

- Created a Microsoft Outlook Add-in which allowed customers to schedule video conferences without leaving Outlook. This resulted in a more salable product for users who prefer Outlook. Increases in sales figures were not shared with me.
- Enabled clients to chat and have video conferences on mobile by implementing two Cordova apps (iOS & Android) which resulted in increased product sales and team communication while traveling.
- Migrated homegrown frontend framework to Vue/Vuex by implementing a go-between library so that our team could migrate frontend over time. This resulted in an unmeasured yet obvious productivity increase across all development projects.
- Implemented feature management suite using native JavaScript, web sockets, and Java which resulted in the ability for customers to opt-in/out-out of paid features as well as the businesses ability to globally manage features across all clients.
- Implemented an email and calendar client using Microsoft Graph and Vue so that customers did not need to leave our platform. Integrating these products into our platform helped achieve the overarching goal of cross-feature integrations. The ultimate result was a more salable platform.
- Maintained our single-page application by mentoring devs, participating in design sessions, and coding features created by our product team. This resulted in an all-in-one collaboration platform well-suited for small to enterprise customers supporting mobile, desktop, and web.

**Founder, Buddy Lee Technology, LLC, May 2015 - Mar 2018**

- Created no code app platform and won private investor funding. The platform was closed due to disagreements between the investor and myself.
- Worked with leadership to create an IT Asset Lifecycle Management platform by using Ruby on Rails and SQL. This resulted in a new product line for the hardware reseller.
- Worked with a leadership to build an iPaaS (integration platform as a service) for the education industry using Ruby and JavaScript which contributed to the company being acquired by Microsoft.
